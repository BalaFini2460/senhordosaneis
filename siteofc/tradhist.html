            In the dawn of time, the gods forged the Rings of Power and gave them to the various races that populated the world.
            Nine rings were given to the kings of men, seven rings to the kings of dwarves, and three rings to the kings of elves.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            However, Sauron, an evil god, learned the secret of the creation of the rings and forged the One Ring, so powerful that it could dominate all the others. With the One Ring in his possession, he spread Evil across the world, enslaving the kings of men and transforming them into the Black Riders, servants of the Ring. In a titanic battle between the forces of Good and Evil that marked the end of the Second Age, the Ring was taken from Sauron, and the forces of Evil were defeated. Sauron lost his physical form, and his spirit became trapped in the land of Mordor.
        </p>

            The story of the first two Ages of the World, including the creation of the Rings of Power and Sauron's defeat, is told in the book "The Silmarillion." This account lays the foundation for the epic events described in *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*.
