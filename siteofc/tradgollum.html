            <h1> Early Life </h1>

            <p>The people of Sméagol lived in the Vales of Anduin near the Gladden Fields. They were descendants of the
                Hobbit lineage of Stoors, who migrated there from Eriador around 1356. They remained more primitive than
                the Hobbits who settled in the Shire, but they had common customs and features.

                Sméagol was probably born in the first half of the century starting in 2400. He was a member of a large,
                prosperous, and respected family. His grandmother was the matriarch of the family, and Sméagol lived in
                her burrow. Sméagol was curious and inquisitive and liked to dig under things to see what was underneath.
            </p>

            <h1> The Discovery of the Ring </h1>

            <p>
                On Sméagol's birthday in 2463, he went fishing in the Gladden Fields with his friend Déagol, who was
                likely related to Sméagol. Déagol was pulled into the water by a fish and emerged with a gold ring that
                he found on the riverbed. Unknown to Sméagol and Déagol, it was the One Ring, which belonged to the Dark
                Lord Sauron and had been lost when Isildur was killed in the Gladden Fields in year 2. When Sméagol saw
                the Ring, he immediately desired it and asked Déagol to give it to him as a birthday present. Déagol
                refused, and Sméagol strangled him and took the Ring for himself. He hid the body, and no one ever
                discovered what happened to Déagol.
            </p>

            <p>
                Shortly after returning home, Sméagol discovered that the Ring made him invisible. He used it for
                malicious purposes, such as stealing and discovering secrets. Sméagol began to be avoided and despised
                by his family, who started calling him Gollum because of the strange noises he began to make in his
                throat. Finally, Sméagol's grandmother expelled him from their home.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sméagol wandered north along the edges of the Anduin. He began to hate the sunlight. One day he followed
                a stream toward the Misty Mountains and discovered a cave that led to the depths of the mountains.
                Sméagol left the eternal world behind and descended into the darkness.
            </p>

            <p>
                For nearly 500 years, Gollum lived on an island in an underground lake located in a cavern far below the
                surface. He used a small boat to fish and sometimes used the Ring to sneak among the Orcs. He did not
                discover great secrets under the mountains, only darkness and emptiness. He was miserable and alone, and
                Déagol's murder haunted him.
            </p>

            <p>
                Gollum's mind was consumed by the Ring, but it was not entirely destroyed. A small part of his old
                personality remained. His body gradually changed to the point where he was practically unrecognizable as
                a Hobbit. He became thin and lost most of his hair, and only six of his teeth remained. In the darkness,
                his eyes became pale and luminous, and his vision grew sharper.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Ring prolonged Gollum's life but did not weaken him because he had the Hobbit's resilience and
                because he did not need to use it often in the darkness of his cave. He kept the Ring in his pocket for
                some time until he could no longer carry it and then hid it in a hole on his island. But the Ring
                constantly troubled his mind, and he continued to fetch it to keep it and look at it. The Ring became a
                torment and a burden to Gollum, and yet he called it his Precious and could not let it go.
            </p>

            <p>
                "He hated it and loved it, just as he hated and loved himself. He could not get rid of it. In this matter, he had no free will left."
